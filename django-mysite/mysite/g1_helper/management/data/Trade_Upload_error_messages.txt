# TRADE UPLOAD ERROR MESSAGES
# If ‘Y’ appears in the Posted column this indicates that the transaction would still be posted on Global One but that a warning message will also be shown on the Transactions Successfully Posted Report. Note that the messages relating to Credit Limits will appear on the Successfully Posted Report only if the System Parameter is set as a warning where this is applicable. If this parameter is set as an error then the new trade will be rejected and the message will appear on the Transaction Upload Error Report. The error code will also be included within the Trade Upload Confirmation File. Where ‘B’ appears in the Posted column this indicates the message can be shown both as a warning, if the trade or return has been posted and has no other errors, or as an error where the trade or return has not been posted. The error message will thus appear on either the Transaction Upload Error report or the Transactions Successfully Posted report, as applicable. The Message Status Indicator within the Trade Upload Confirmation file will show whether the message is an error or a warning.
