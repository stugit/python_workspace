TYPE=DETAIL
|RECORD_TYPE||X(1)|1,1|= 1. |
|TRADE_REFERENCE|BREF|X(12)|2,12|This should contain the reference for either the individual trade or return being settled or marked, rate changed or unsettled, the Bulk Cash Pool Reference for a Cash Pool Mark, Rate Change or Term Date Change, or the Bulk Reference Id where ‘B’ is set in the Bulk Settlement field. In version 4.8 the Cash Pool Extended Reference was added. This should not be included here as part of the Bulk Cash Pool Reference but populated in the separate Bulk Cash Pool Extended Reference field in position 295,3. |
|ACTIVITY_TRANSACTION_NUMBER|TREF|X(9)|14,9|This should contain the Pending Mark Identifier if the Settled Indicator is ‘P’. This identifier will need to be ascertained from the Pending Marks details generated for a pending mark batch. In version 4.7 functionality was added so that this could also be used for Activity Deletions. |
|COUNTERPARTY_CODE|CPTY|X(6)|23,6|Not checked if a Bulk Settlement. |
|CASH_SETTLEMENT_DATE|CSDT|X(8)|29,8|CCYYMMDD. Only needed if the settlement record is for cash unless it is a Bulk record. In this case it should always be present. Also used for Pending Marks and for Marks processed on trades and Bulk Cash Pools and for Term dates and rate changes entered for Bulk Cash Pools. |
|CASH_SETTLEMENT_VALUE|CSVL|S9(11).9(2)|37,15|This is the value of the cash settling for a trade or return or the value of a Mark. This needs to be populated where the Settled Indicator shows both or cash are being settled on a nonDVP cash item. For marks or Cash Pool marks this value should incorporate either a minus sign (negative mark) or a zero (positive mark) in the first character of the field. For a Bulk record this should contain the value of the Bulk Settlement whether the Settled Indicator is set to space, ‘S’ or ‘C’ for a non-DVP cash bulk item. See note 1. |
|CASH_SETTLEMENT_CURRENCY|CSCU|X(3)|52,3|Only required if cash settlement date and value are present. |
|SECURITY_SETTLEMENT_DATE|SSDT|X(8)|55,8|CCYYMMDD. Only needed if the settlement record is for security unless this is a Bulk record. In this case it should always be present. This should also be present if the rate change is for a trade, rather than for a Bulk Cash Pool, and should contain the effective date. |
|SECURITY_SETTLEMENT_VALUE|SSVL|S9(11).9(2)|63,15|The settlement value of the trade or return is only required for a Settled Indicator of ‘S’ or space on either a DVP single or bulk item. See note 1. |
|SECURITY_SETTLEMENT_QUANTITY|QTY|S9(11)|78,12|The quantity is required for a Settled Indicator of ‘S’ or space. If this is a Bulk record it should contain the total quantity, whether the indicator is set to space, ‘S’ or ‘C’. See note 1. |

Version 4.4 added the Settled Indicator of ‘V’ - Change No Rollover. Version 4.8 added ‘T’ option for Term date change on Bulk Cash Pool. It also added ‘B’ to allow a Mark and Rate Change to be processed on a Bulk Cash Pool together. Version 4.9 prevented the V-Change No Rollover function being used for rate changes on Non-Dollar Repo trades, as the R-Rate Change indicator should now be used. |
|FAIL_CODE|FCDE|X(3)|91,3|Valid Fail Code. Only used for a SETTLED INDICATOR of ‘F’ or null. If FAIL CODE is null and SETTLED INDICATOR is ‘F’ then will remove any existing fail code. |
|PRE_PAYMENT_RATE_OR_NEW_RATE|PPRT|S9(2).9(6)|94,10|The Pre-Payment Rate is applicable to cash being settled before the security. Can be negative. The New Rate is applicable to a rate change on a trade or bulk cash pool and is checked against the Rate Warning Level system parameter. Negative rates of more than 100 should be provided with a specific decimal place, e.g. a rate of -102 should be passed as -102.00000 to fit the 10 characters allowed in the field. This field was also changed in Version 4.4 to allow the new rate for a Repo Change No Rollover function. See note 1. |
|FUND_CODE|FUND|X(6)|104,6|Only used for a Settled Indicator of ‘P’ or Fund Level Cash Pool Marks. |

|TRANSACTION_NARRATIVE|TXNR|X(20)|166,20|User defined text/reference. This will be shown in the Acceptance file record where this is used but no other enquiry on Global One is available for this narrative. |
|DIRECT_MARK_ACCRUED_INTEREST|DMAI|S9(11).9(2)|186,15|Value of Accrued Interest for US Dollar type repos. Used to generate Mark Interest Activities as part of the Marks Update. Can be negative for an accrual adjustment. |

|REPO_TERM_DATE|RTMD|X(8)|233,8|CCYYMMDD. Only needed for a change to the Term Date for Term Repos during the Change No Rollover process. New returns will be created with this date. Blank will assume current term date. |
|REPO_EFFECTIVE_DATE|REFD|X(8)|241,8|CCYYMMDD – Only needed for Repo Change No Rollover. Will be used as effective date for rate changes and marks.

|REPO_MOVEMENT_VALUE|RMVV|9(12).9(2)|249,15|New value of Repo used in Repo Change No Rollover. This will be used for the value of a new pending return created and to determine if a mark is to be posted. A mark will be calculated using the difference between this value and the current outstanding trade value. If this field is blank and there is a Movement Price (please see below) then the value will be calculated using the price, however if both the price and value are blank then no mark is created. |
|REPO_ACCRUED_INTEREST|RACI|S9(11).9(2)|264,15|Override Accrued Interest for Term Repo Change No Rollover only. If blank the accrual will be calculated using term date, value and rate. |

If this is blank or if the Movement Value field is populated the new price will be calculated from the value and the quantity of the repo. If populated and the Movement Value is blank then this is used to determine the mark. If the Movement Value and Movement Price fields are both blank then no mark is created. |
|OVERRIDE_DOLLAR_MARK_ACCRUED_INTEREST|ODMA|X(1)|294,1|If set to ‘Y’ for Dollar Repo marks, and the uploaded Mark Accrued Interest is different to the value which is calculated by Global One, then the mark will be posted. Otherwise the mark will be rejected. |

Where multiple trade cross references are used for the same trade on Global One, an array position may be specified which will mean that the reference is then unique. This position will be used when storing the trade cross references for a new trade. This field can then be used when specifying the position of the correct trade cross reference to be used to identify the trade when posting updates through the Settlement Upload. |
|CREST_TRANSACTION_NUMBER|CTRA|X(16)|338,16|CREST Transaction Number. Populated from CREST processing, wherever the transaction is passed to the Settlement Upload. Stored in ITXN<54>. |
