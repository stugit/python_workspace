|ADF1_MIXED_TRI_PARTY||INDICATOR|2,20|For use with the Agency Lending Disclosure module. Possible values for this field are Null for Not Applicable (not used for ALD), ‘M’ for Mixed Trade (only available for cash trades) or ‘T’ Tri-Party Trade (only applicable for non-cash or cash pool trades and for collateral items). |
|ADF2_DISCLOSED||INDICATOR|22,20|For use with the Agency Lending Disclosure module. Possible values are ‘D’ for Disclosed, ‘N’ for NonDisclosed or ‘E’ for Exclusive. ADF3 COLLATERAL REMEDY CODE 42,20 For use with the Agency Lending Disclosure module. There is no default for this field. When set to ‘X’ the Collateral Type field in the ALD Daily File will also be set to ‘X’ if the Open Date (initial settled date) for the trade matches the Global One system date. If this field is populated, but the Open Date does not match the Global One system date, the Collateral Type field in the Daily File will be populated accordingly with C, N, M, or P.  ADF4 SPECIAL FEATURE FLAG 62,20 For use with the Agency Lending Disclosure module. Enter ‘P’ to indicate if this pending non-cash trade has pre-paid non-cash collateral. If this is the case, the pending trade will be included in the ALD Daily File. Enter ‘X’ here to exclude this pending non-cash trade from the collateral allocation processing and the ALD Daily File. This field will default to ‘P’ for counterparties listed on the Non-Cash Collateral Prepay Table. |
|ADF5_MATCHING_TRADE||DATE|82,20|For use with the SWIFT module. This field allows the trade date on a trade or return to be entered to match the security settlement due date. If populated a valid date is required. |
|ADF6_MGL_ACCOUNT_BOOK||CODE|102,20|For use with the Global One/Martini synchronisation project. An Account/Book code is required to be passed from Martini to down-stream general ledger systems, but is not required in Global One itself. The Martini Global One Link (MGL) will pass this date in the Trade Upload GCI message. |
|ADF7_INDEX_RATE||CODE|122,20|The population of the Index Rate Code, Index Rate Increment and Index Rate Update fields identify a trade as being an index rate trade.  If there is a rate in the Interest Rate field in Trade Upload, the index rate fields on the Other Information screen in Global One will not be used, whether they are populated or not, and the trade will be a non-index rate trade. If there is no Interest Rate value then the values in the index rate Additional/Other fields in Trade Upload will populate the index rate fields on the Other Information screen in Global One. The trade is then an index rate trade.  The validation in Trade Upload checks that: a) The Index Rate Code exists in Global One b) The Index Rate Increment is numeric, with a format of 3 figures before the decimal point and 6 after, and c) The update type is ‘A’, ‘M’ or null. |
